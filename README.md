- A web API or Application Programming Interface is an API accessed using the HTTP protocol. Web APIs often deliver data formatted as JSON
- A web API can be accessed programmatically using JavaScript. The API documentation must first be consulted in order to understand how the API works and what it returns
- Use jQuery to post AJAX requests asynchronously
- Use the Postman app to test API requests/responses
- Use NodeJS and Express for a testing server
- Use jQuery, JavaScript, and public APIs to fetch JSON data, then use if to refresh part of a web page
